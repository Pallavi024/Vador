== Why Vader?

[.lead]
On core, there is no de-facto standard to write bean validations

link:docs/requirements.adoc[Requirements that lead to the birth of Vader]

Validation orchestration is predominantly done with `if-else-try-catch` pyramids, similar to https://github.com/overfullstack/railway-oriented-validation/blob/master/src/main/java/app/imperative/ImperativeValidation.java[this].
A domain may have more than 60 validations across its batch & non-batch services.
Having validations as loose functions for the above requirements, can create a mess of function calls:

image:function-call-mess.png[inline]

This approach can spike the https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-cq03316/[*Cyclomatic Complexity*]
and https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf[*Cognitive Complexity*] metrics and renders a code-base which is difficult to test, extend and maintain.

=== The 3D design problem

This problem is a 3-dimensional design problem stretching among - Sub-requests, Service routes (that share common fields & data structures), and Validation count.
In the above imperative approach, we entangled all 3, which lead to chaos.
We need a design, which treats all of these separately, let them be extended independently, and abstracts out validation orchestration.

== What's Vader?

[.lead]
Vader is an independent Bean validation framework, not tied to any REST framework.

It's agnostic of its consumer's Rest framework, Request data-type or failure representation.
Although it's written with the context explained above, its implementation is generic and can cater to anyone looking for a declarative way to validate their Beans/POJOs.

Vader follows *Functional Programming* philosophy to segregate _What-to-do_ from _How-to-do_.

[.lead]
The framework asks your validations to be broken into 3 *_decoupled_* parts:

* Validations _(What-to-do)_ - Write your validations as First-Class Functions.
* Configuration _(How-to-do)_ - Stitch your validations together into a Chain.
* Orchestration _(How-to-do)_ - Call the API function as per the execution strategy (Fail-Fast or Error-Accumulation)

Let's dive into how Vader can help you in each of these steps:

== ∆õ Data-types for Lambda

The job of validator is simple, just to convey if a POJO is valid or why it's invalid (in the form of a Validation Failure).

Vader provides various *Validator Data-Types*, to get this done.
These are https://www.baeldung.com/java-8-functional-interfaces[Functional Interfaces] to which a lambda can be assigned.

== Validator `(ValidatableT) -> FailureT`

The Data type for simple first-class functions.
It takes in a bean to be validated, represented by `ValidatableT`, and returns a failure `FailureT`.

[source,java,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
----
public static final Validator<Container, ValidationFailure> validation1 =
  containerInputRepresentation -> {
    if(containerInputRepresentation._isSetPaymentAuthorizationId()) {
      return null;
    } else {
      return new ValidationFailure(...);
    }
  };
----

== If you need more ‚ö°Ô∏èPower‚ö°Ô∏è

image:more-power.gif[inline]

== ValidatorEtr (`(Either<FailureT, ValidatableT>) -> Either<FailureT, ?>`)

=== https://docs.vavr.io/#_either[Either Monad]

Unlike `Validator` type (which works with Simple input/output types), `ValidatorEtr` lambda type works with `Either`
type as input/output.
The `Either` type is borrowed from https://docs.vavr.io/#_either[Vavr].

=== What's so powerful about `Either`?

With `Either`, You get all the functional programming powers.
You can write linear programs with a lot less *Cyclomatic Complexity* & *Cognitive Complexity*.

Please refer to this tech talk discussing these concepts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvr6gx4XaD8&list=PLrJbJ9wDl9EC0bG6y9fyDylcfmB_lT_Or["Fight Complexity with Functional Programming - Gopal S. Akshintala - All Things Open, USA, 2020"]

Lambdas assigned to `ValidatorEtr` take `Either<FailureT, ValidatableT>` as input and should return `Either<FailureT, ?>`.
Since the bean is pre-wrapped in an `Either`, you can perform all the `Either` operations on the input like `map` , `flatMap`, `fold`, `filterOrElse` ( Refer https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.vavr/vavr/0.10.2/io/vavr/control/Either.html[API] for more info).

If there is a Validation Failure, keep the result in the _left_ state.
If the `Either` in the result is in the _right_ state, it is considered that the bean **Passed** the validation.
The wildcard `?` signifies it doesn't matter what's the value in the right state.

[source,java,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
----
public static final ValidatorEtr<Container, ValidationFailure> batchValidation1 =
  containerInputRepresentation -> containerInputRepresentation
    .filterOrElse(Container::_isSetAccountId, ignore-> new ValidationFailure(..);
----

TIP: Of-course, pre-wrapping bean into `Either` is just to avoid boiler-plate.
You can very well use `Validator` and wrap/unwrap the bean yourself.

== Why are there different Validator types?

[.lead]
These types only differ syntactically

They are there to help developers focus only on their validation logic, not worry about boiler-plate and use a programming style (imperative or functional) that they are comfortable in.
You can essentially use any Data type for your validators and in-fact you can even have a mix, based on your needs.

NOTE: Vader leaves the choice to the developer!

== How to Stitch these Validators?

Validators for different beans can be written in their own java classes.
Using lambdas, we essentially *use functions as values*.
So, all we need is an Ordered List (like `java.util.List`) to maintain the sequence of validations.
We can chain all the validators, in the order of preference.

[source,java,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
----
List<ValidatorEtr<Container, ValidationFailure> validatorChain = List.of(validator1, validator2,...);
----

== How to combine Container & Member validators?

But there's a catch!
A List of Validators for a container node consists of a mix of all container validators and all its nested member validators.
But they can't be put under one `List`, as they are functions on different Data Types.

[source,java,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
----
ValidatorEtr<Container, ValidationFailure> containerValidator =...; // Apply same analogy for Validator
ValidatorEtr<Member, ValidationFailure> memberValidator =...;
List.of(containerValidator, memberValidator); // ^^^ Compile Error
----

So all nested member validators need to be lifted to the container type, essentially changing their type matching with the Container's, like: `ValidatorEtr<Container, ValidationFailure>`.

We can achieve this with `org.revcloud.vader.lift.*Util` functions.
These are *Higher-Order Functions*, which *lift* member validator to the container type.
This takes a `containerToMemberMapper` which is function to extract member from container.

[source,java,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
----
ValidatorEtr<Member, ValidationFailure> memberValidator =...;
ValidatorEtr<Container, ValidationFailure> liftedMemberValidator =...;
List.of(containerValidator, liftToContainerValidatorType(memberValidator, containerToMemberMapper)); // Happy Compiler :)
----

image:lift.jpg[]

This way, we can configure a *Chain* of validators in-order, sorting out all the container-member dependencies.
This is nothing but, the most popular *Chain of Responsibility* Design pattern, with a functional touch-up.

If the inter-dependencies between Container-Member happens to be more complex, we may end-up with _Graph_ relationship, but we can easily _flatten_ it into a Chain with a simple _Topological Sort_.

== How to combine Validators & ValidatorEtrs?

TIP: If you are using link:docs/config-dsl/configDSLs.adoc[Config DSL] from 2.0, you don't need to worry about this, unless you are particular about the order of validators.

Similarly, Vader has utils to lift `Validator` to `ValidatorEtr`.
This is handy, when you have a mix of validations, and they all need to be of the same type to stitch them together.

== Lift Util

Below are the utils currently available, with self-explanatory names.
There are multiple overloads suitable for simple/non-simple.
The Java Docs should guide you to use proper overload:

=== Aggregation Util: To lift Member validator to Container validator type

These are available for both `Validator` and `ValidatorEtr`.

[cols="<,<"]
|===
|liftToContainerValidatorType |liftAllToContainerValidatorType
|liftToContainerValidatorType |liftAllToContainerValidatorType
|===

=== Validator Util: To lift Simple validator to ValidatorEtr type

[cols="<,<"]
|===
|lift |liftAll
|===

== Deferred result

If you skim through the source code, you can realize none of these Util functions does any execution.
These Higher-Order functions simply take-in a function and return a lifted function, deferring the actual execution until you call any API method from `Vader/VaderBatch` below:

== Validation Execution Strategies

Now that we know how to write & wire validations, the last step to execute these validations is to *call an execution method, passing this config as a parameter*.

This can be seen as the *Edge* for validation bounded context, where the actual execution of validations happen, and you get back the final results.
_The complexity of how these validators are orchestrated per strategy is abstracted away from the consumer._

*There are various orchestration flavors (Overloads) from `Vader` and `VaderBatch` APIs (Please refer to Java Docs)*.

[discrete]
== `validateAndFailFastForEach(...)`

[discrete]
== `validateAndFailFastForAny(...)`

[discrete]
== `validateAndAccumulateErrors(...)`

[discrete]
== What about exceptions?

These API methods accept a parameter called `throwableMapper: (Throwable) -> FailureT`.
If any of your validations throws a checked or unchecked exception, it shall be mapped into a `FailureT` using this function.

== How can I trust Vader?

[.lead]
Well, coz that‚Äôs the bread-&-jam of what we promise

* It‚Äôs our responsibility to address all the edge cases and automate them thoroughly, for various types of POJOs.
* We take code-quality & security seriously!
** This code base has integration with https://sonarqube.soma.salesforce.com/dashboard?id=ccspayments.vader[*SonarQube*].
** We openly display our <<shields, Code-Quality Shields>> at the top.
* This is currently being consumed in *Production*
** By 3 Teams:
*** Rev-Hydra
*** Rev-Delphinus
*** Rev-Centaurus
** In 3 different domains
*** Payments
*** Tax
*** Billing
* This idea was presented as a Tech-talk at many https://overfullstack.ga/posts/fight-complexity-with-fp/#My-Talk-on-this[International Conferences & Meetups]

That said, just like us, Vader matures day-by-day, and if any of your special use-cases don‚Äôt work, we shall love to fix them ASAP (TBD - Will publish SLA for P0, P1 etc).
