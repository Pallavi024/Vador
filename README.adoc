== USP for Vader

=== Why a framework for Validations?

====

link:{docsdir}/requirements.adoc[Requirements that led to the birth of Vader]

üîä https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49WFdDIFlAs[The birth of Lord Vader] playing in the background

image:birth-of-vader.gif[inline]

====

Validations are predominantly done with `if-else-try-catch` pyramids, similar to https://github.com/overfullstack/railway-oriented-validation/blob/master/src/main/java/app/imperative/ImperativeValidation.java[this].
A domain may have many validations across its batch & non-batch services.
Having validations as loose functions and using exceptions to halt the validation flow for the above requirements, can create a mess of function calls and execution flow.

image:function-call-mess.png[function-call-mess]

This approach can spike the https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-cq03316/[*Cyclomatic Complexity*]
and https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf[*Cognitive Complexity*] metrics and renders a code-base which is difficult to test, extend and maintain.

TIP: Good read about https://blog.sonarsource.com/cognitive-complexity-because-testability-understandability[Cyclomatic Complexity vs Cognitive Complexity]

=== Why Vader?

If you are convinced that you need a framework for validations, why use Vader?

[.lead]
Developed at an API first company _Salesforce_, Vader is designed to ease and ace REST API validation.

But, Vader is an independent *POJO/Bean validation framework*, not tied to any consumer implementation details. Its implementation is generic and can cater to anyone looking for a declarative way to validate their Beans/POJOs.

It has a unique approach of decoupling *What-to-do* from *How-to-do*. The framework asks your validation layer to be broken into *_3 decoupled_* parts:

* ‚úåüèºValidatable _(What-to-do)_ - The Data-Structure/Bean to be Validated
* üß∂Configuration _(What-to-do)_ - Declare your validation validators/specifications/rules/constraints through a DSL (builder).
* ‚öôÔ∏èExecution Strategy _(How-to-do)_ - Call the Vader's API as per the execution strategy (Fail-Fast or Error-Accumulation)

==== USP

This decoupling comes with a lot of flexibility. Some unique selling points about Vader:

* As Config resides outside Validatable, unlike annotation based frameworks, you can declare config for classes that are not part of your code-base/module.
* You can share Config for a Validatable across different Execution strategies.
* You can re-use a nested-member config while validating its Container.
* Config promotes Low-Code validations, and comes with plug-and-play validators out-of-the-box that are suitable for REST APIs validation use-cases.
* Failure type `FailureT` is generic and Consumer has the flexibility to use a failure type of his own.
* Vader comes with Execution Strategy algorithms out-of-the-box, even for complex data-structures like batch-of-batch (which might need a Tree-Traversal algorithm).

Watch this Tech-talk as a prerequisite to understand the problem Vader solves and its design philosophy.
It explains why `if-else-try-catch` is easy to start but difficult to manage and how Vader takes all that complexity away:

[.lead]
So, all you need is a simple API call:

image:api.png[API]

== link:{docsdir}/config-dsl/config-driven-validation.adoc[üß∂Config driven Validation]

== ‚öôÔ∏èExecution Strategy

* Execution Strategy is how you want to Orchestrate your Validations against the Data-structure.
* Orchestration complexity can be directly proportional to the Data structure complexity. For example, a batch-of-batch data structure might need to a Tree-Traversal algorithm (Ref: link:{docsdir}/config-dsl/nested/BatchOfBatch1ValidationConfig.adoc[BatchOfBatch1ValidationConfig])
* Vader provides all these Execution Strategies out-of-the-box for non-batch, batch and even batch-of-batch data structures:

[#_what_if_there_is_an_exception_during_execution]
=== üí£ What if there is an Exception during execution üí•?

All these API methods accept an optional parameter called `throwableMapper: (Throwable) -> FailureT`, which needs to be implemented and supplied by the consumer.
If any of consumer's validations throws a checked or unchecked exception, it shall be mapped into a `FailureT` using this function.

TIP: You can place a logger or a debug point (during development) in this method you supply, to capture and analyze the exception info like stacktrace, cause etc.
We have plans to add Logger support in the future too.

[#_perks_of_config_based_validation]
== üç´ Perks of Config based Validation

=== Low Learning Curve

Use of same Config pattern through-out, with self-explaining DSL methods to drive your development.
This keeps the scope and slope of your learning curve required, low.

=== Readability

We don't need analogies to stress on how important readability is and how Config is more readable than code with nested `if/else/for`.

=== Maintainability

Strips out a lot of the code/logic to maintain.

=== Reduce Complexity

* No branching => No Cyclomatic complexity/Cognitive complexity.
* It abstracts away all the implementation complexity.
* Saves a lot of Man hours while writing and _10X_ more while reading.
* Eliminates the need to spike on your validation strategy/design.

TIP: An *8-pointer* Story for Free ü§ë

=== Testability

It improves testability in 3 ways:

* It forces you to write your validators as testable lambdas with single responsibility.
* It abstracts away all the well-tested execution logic, so you don't need to worry about testing it.
* Think of writing config as fill in the blanks for well-tested algorithm templates, so you don't need to write any code, which implies no need to write any tests.

NOTE: You can always test your config (to double-check if right values are provided), but no need to re-test the already well-tested implementation.

link:{docsdir}/config-dsl/specs.adoc#_specs_do_not_need_tests[Read about no-tests argument here].
The same argument applies to config as well.

=== Flexibility

* This is decoupled from the API orchestration method.
For example, currently it's *Fail-Fast for Any*.
But if you want to migrate to Fail-Fast for each item (to handle partial failures) or if you have another route like SObject where you need to accumulate all errors, that's as simple as calling a different API method without changing anything else.
* If you wish to skip some validations or add new validations depending on the route, you can have different configs instances for different routes.

=== Extensibility

* Config can easily be modified or extended if your Bean's data-structure changes, with new fields being added or removed.
* Config can easily catch up, even when your service migrates from non-batch to batch mode.

=== Re-usability/Sharing

Config is mapped to a data structure.
Which means, if the validation requirements are same, you can *reuse* the config everywhere the data-structure is used, say with a different API execution strategy.
Even if the data-structure (member) is nested inside another bean (container), the container bean can reuse member validation config and all it's validations without rewriting.

== Applications

It is predominantly used in combination with **REST** services, to validate the unmarshalled POJO from the REST request/response JSON.

It can also be used for SObject Validation hooks or even FTests. This is generic and can be used wherever you find a requirement to run a bunch of validations or rules on a POJO. It‚Äôs not tied to any domain or framework. It‚Äôs not even tied to Backend services; you can use Vader even in Android apps.

== How can I trust Vader?

[.lead]
Well, coz that‚Äôs the *bread-&-jam* üçûü•´ of what we promise!

* It‚Äôs our responsibility to address all the edge cases and automate them thoroughly, for various types of POJOs.
* We take code-quality & security seriously!
** This code base has integration with https://sonarqube.soma.salesforce.com/dashboard?id=ccspayments.vader[*SonarQube*], where you can verify code-coverage, security of libraries used etc.

|Payments
|Tax
|Billing
|===

This idea was presented as a Tech-talk at many https://overfullstack.ga/posts/fight-complexity-with-fp/#My-Talk-on-this[International Conferences & Meetups]

That said, just like us, Vader matures day-by-day, and if any of your special use-cases don‚Äôt work, we shall love to fix them ASAP (TBD - Will publish SLA for P0, P1 etc).

NOTE: üëãüèº If you are facing any trouble or have any feature requests, please log a GitHub issue üëãüèº

== How can I get my hands dirty?

There are so many unit tests in the repo written for various features. You can start by understanding, playing with, or even writing new unit-tests to get hands-on experience with Vader.

== How can our team on-board?

Currently, link:https://salesforce-internal.slack.com/archives/C0228BHJCQP[Rev-Delphinus] maintains this repo. Feel free to ping in our link:https://salesforce-internal.slack.com/archives/C0228BHJCQP[slack channel] if you are interested to discuss more about adopting Vader for your requirements. We can provide 1:1 support and mentoring for all your doubts and feature requests.

NOTE: Vader isn‚Äôt for some complex validation requirements. It makes even the simple validation requirements simpler. Plus, you don‚Äôt have to go full-on with the framework. All features are modular, so you may get your feet wet by migrating a small portion of your validation layer and incrementally adopt.
