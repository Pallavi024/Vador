== Why Vader?

[.lead]
On core, there is no de-facto standard to write bean validations.

====

Validations are predominantly done with `if-else-try-catch` pyramids, similar to https://github.com/overfullstack/railway-oriented-validation/blob/master/src/main/java/app/imperative/ImperativeValidation.java[this].
A domain may have many validations across its batch & non-batch services.
Having validations as loose functions and using exceptions to halt the validation flow for the above requirements, can create a mess of function calls and execution flow.

image:function-call-mess.png[function-call-mess]

This approach can spike the https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-cq03316/[*Cyclomatic Complexity*]
and https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf[*Cognitive Complexity*] metrics and renders a code-base which is difficult to test, extend and maintain.

Watch this Tech-talk as a prerequisite to understand the problem Vader solves and its design philosophy.
It explains why `if-else-try-catch` is easy to start but difficult to manage and how Vader takes all that complexity away:

== TL;DR Show me the code

== What's Vader?

[.lead]
Vader is an independent *POJO/Bean validation framework*, not tied to any consumer implementation details.

Its implementation is generic and can cater to anyone looking for a declarative way to validate their Beans/POJOs.

The framework asks your validation strategy to be broken into *_3 decoupled_* parts:

* Write your Validators _(What-to-do)_ - The lambdas/functions used for validations should abide to one of the link:{docdir}/validator-types.adoc[Validator types] provided by Vader.
* Configuration _(How-to-do)_ - Stitch your validations together into a Chain.
* Execution _(How-to-do)_ - Call the Vader's API as per the execution strategy (Fail-Fast or Error-Accumulation)

Vader follows *Functional Programming* philosophy to segregate _What-to-do_ from _How-to-do_.

Let's start bottoms-up 🥂!

____
We're *zealous* about keeping the dev experience simple and the patterns uniform.
____

So, all you need is a simple API call:

[#_what_if_there_is_an_exception_during_execution]
=== 💣 What if there is an Exception during execution 💥?

All these API methods accept an optional parameter called `throwableMapper: (Throwable) -> FailureT`, which needs to be implemented and supplied by the consumer.
If any of consumer's validations throws a checked or unchecked exception, it shall be mapped into a `FailureT` using this function.

TIP: You can place a logger or a debug point (during development) in this method you supply, to capture and analyze the exception info like stacktrace, cause etc.
We have plans to add Logger support in the future too.

== link:{docsdir}/validation-configuration.adoc[Config For Validation]

== 🍫 Perks of Config based Validation

=== Low Learning Curve

Use of same Config pattern through-out, with self-explaining DSL methods to drive your development.
This keeps the scope and slope of your learning curve required, low.

=== Readability

We don't need analogies to stress on how important readability is and how Config is more readable than code with nested `if/else/for`.

=== Maintainability

Strips out a lot of the code/logic to maintain.

=== Reduce Complexity

* No branching => No Cyclomatic complexity/Cognitive complexity.
* It abstracts away all the implementation complexity.
* Saves a lot of Man hours while writing and _10X_ more while reading.
* Eliminates the need to spike on your validation strategy/design.

TIP: An *8-pointer* Story for Free 🤑

=== Testability

It improves testability in 3 ways:

* It forces you to write your validators as testable lambdas with single responsibility.
* It abstracts away all the well-tested execution logic, so you don't need to worry about testing it.
* Think of writing config as fill in the blanks for well-tested algorithm templates, so you don't need to write any code, which implies no need to write any tests.

NOTE: You can always test your config (to double-check if right values are provided), but no need to re-test the already well-tested implementation.

link:{docsdir}/specs.adoc#_specs_do_not_need_tests[Read about no-tests argument here].
The same argument applies to config as well.

=== Flexibility

* This is decoupled from the API orchestration method.
For example, currently it's *Fail-Fast for Any*.
But if you want to migrate to Fail-Fast for each item (to handle partial failures) or if you have another route like SObject where you need to accumulate all errors, that's as simple as calling a different API method without changing anything else.
* If you wish to skip some validations or add new validations depending on the route, you can have different configs instances for different routes.

=== Extensibility

* Config can easily be modified or extended if your Bean's data-structure changes, with new fields being added or removed.
* Config can easily catch up, even when your service migrates from non-batch to batch mode.

=== Re-usability/Sharing

Config is mapped to a data structure.
Which means, if the validation requirements are same, you can *reuse* the config everywhere the data-structure is used, say with a different API execution strategy.
Even if the data-structure (member) is nested inside another bean (container), the container bean can reuse member validation config and all it's validations without rewriting.

== How can I trust Vader?

[.lead]
Well, coz that’s the *bread-&-jam* of what we promise!

* It’s our responsibility to address all the edge cases and automate them thoroughly, for various types of POJOs.
* We take code-quality & security seriously!
** This code base has integration with https://sonarqube.soma.salesforce.com/dashboard?id=ccspayments.vader[*SonarQube*], where you can verify code-coverage, security of libraries used etc.
** We openly display our <<shields, Code-Quality Shields>> at the top.

[#_impact]
== Impact ☄️

Vader has Consumer in *Production*:

4 Teams:

|===
|Rev-Hydra
|Rev-Delphinus
|Rev-Centaurus
|Rev-Pegasus
|===

In 3 different domains:

|===
|Payments
|Tax
|Billing
|===

This idea was presented as a Tech-talk at many https://overfullstack.ga/posts/fight-complexity-with-fp/#My-Talk-on-this[International Conferences & Meetups]

That said, just like us, Vader matures day-by-day, and if any of your special use-cases don’t work, we shall love to fix them ASAP (TBD - Will publish SLA for P0, P1 etc).
