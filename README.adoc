== Why Vader?

[.lead]
On core, there is no de-facto standard to write bean validations

link:{docsdir}/requirements.adoc[Requirements that lead to the birth of Vader]

Validation orchestration is predominantly done with `if-else-try-catch` pyramids, similar to https://github.com/overfullstack/railway-oriented-validation/blob/master/src/main/java/app/imperative/ImperativeValidation.java[this].
A domain may have more than 60 validations across its batch & non-batch services.
Having validations as loose functions for the above requirements, can create a mess of function calls:

image:function-call-mess.png[inline]

This approach can spike the https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-cq03316/[*Cyclomatic Complexity*]
and https://www.sonarsource.com/{docsdir}/CognitiveComplexity.pdf[*Cognitive Complexity*] metrics and renders a code-base which is difficult to test, extend and maintain.

=== The 3D design problem

This problem is a 3-dimensional design problem stretching among - Sub-requests, Service routes (that share common fields & data structures), and Validation count.
In the above imperative approach, we entangled all 3, which lead to chaos.
We need a design, which treats all of these separately, let them be extended independently, and abstracts out validation orchestration.

____

We need to separate *What-to-do* from *How-to-do.*

=== Demo pls!

Watch this Tech-talk as a prerequisite to understand the problem Vader solves.
It explains why `if-else-try-catch` is easy to start but difficult to manage and how Vader takes all that complexity away:

== What's Vader?

[.lead]
Vader is an independent Bean validation framework, not tied to any consumer implementation details.

Although it's written with the context explained above, its implementation is generic and can cater to anyone looking for a declarative way to validate their Beans/POJOs.

Vader follows *Functional Programming* philosophy to segregate _What-to-do_ from _How-to-do_.

[.lead]
The framework asks your validation strategy to be broken into *_3 decoupled_* parts:

* Write your Validations _(What-to-do)_ - The functions used for validations should abide to one of the link:{docdir}/validator-types.adoc[Validator types] provided by Vader.
* Configuration _(How-to-do)_ - Stitch your validations together into a Chain.
* Orchestration _(How-to-do)_ - Call the Vader's API as per the execution strategy (Fail-Fast or Error-Accumulation)

Let's dive into how Vader can help you in each of these steps:

=== link:{docsdir}/validator-types.adoc[∆õ Data-types for Validators]

== Validation Execution Strategies

Now that we know how to write & wire validations, the last step to execute these validations is to *Call an API execution method, passing this config as a parameter*.

[.lead]
This can be seen as the *Edge* for validation bounded context, where the actual execution of validations happen, and you get back the final results.
_The complexity of how these validators are orchestrated per strategy is abstracted away from the consumer._

*There are various orchestration flavors (Overloads) from `Vader` and `VaderBatch` APIs (Please refer to Java Docs)*.

[discrete]
== `validateAndFailFastForEach(...)`

[discrete]
== `validateAndFailFastForAny(...)`

[discrete]
== `validateAndAccumulateErrors(...)`

[discrete]
== üí£ What if Validators threw Exceptions üí•?

These API methods accept an optional parameter called `throwableMapper: (Throwable) -> FailureT`, which needs to be implemented and supplied by the consumer.
If any of consumer's validations throws a checked or unchecked exception, it shall be mapped into a `FailureT` using this function.

TIP: You can place a logger or a debug point (during development) in this method you supply, to capture and analyze the exception info like stacktrace, cause etc.

== How can I trust Vader?

[.lead]
Well, coz that‚Äôs the *bread-&-jam* of what we promise!

* It‚Äôs our responsibility to address all the edge cases and automate them thoroughly, for various types of POJOs.
* We take code-quality & security seriously!
** This code base has integration with https://sonarqube.soma.salesforce.com/dashboard?id=ccspayments.vader[*SonarQube*].
** We openly display our <<shields, Code-Quality Shields>> at the top.
* This is currently being consumed in *Production*
** By 3 Teams:
*** Rev-Hydra
*** Rev-Delphinus
*** Rev-Centaurus
** In 3 different domains
*** Payments
*** Tax
*** Billing
* This idea was presented as a Tech-talk at many https://overfullstack.ga/posts/fight-complexity-with-fp/#My-Talk-on-this[International Conferences & Meetups]

That said, just like us, Vader matures day-by-day, and if any of your special use-cases don‚Äôt work, we shall love to fix them ASAP (TBD - Will publish SLA for P0, P1 etc).
