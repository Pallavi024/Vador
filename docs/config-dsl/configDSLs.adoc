Vader has a powerful and declarative Configuration DSL.
A config object is 1-1 mapped with a Data Structure, and holds all the information/requirements/specifications required to validate that Data-structure.
This is a powerful coz it lets you validate any Bean with any level or nesting, be it _Single_ or _Batch_. It's easy to fit this model in our heads, as validation configuration aligns with Bean hierarchical-structure.

== Config-Driven Validation

There are currently different flavors of configs depending on these factors:

* Is the Data-structure under validation _Single (Non-Batch)_ or _Collection (Batch)_.
* Does the Data-structure HAS-A Nested-Data-structure which needs to be validated too.
** Is the Nested Data-structure _Single (Non-Batch)_ or _Collection (Batch)_.
* Do the validations need to run from Container Context.

== DSL Flavors

Let's walk through each of these flavors with an example bean, validation requirements for its Data-structure and a demo for such requirements using a runnable JUnit test.

NOTE: These examples don't exhaustively cover all the use-cases.
You may refer the Javadoc of each validation config to find-out more.
Also, the unit tests should help with the usage of these fields.
As usual, file a git.soma issue if you have new and unique use-cases.
