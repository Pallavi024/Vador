WARNING: Some of the above are TBD or may support only upto a nesting depth of 1.
As we work on addressing more complex use cases, there is another way where you can manually club Container and Member validations

=== How to combine Container & Member validators?

But, there's a catch!
A List of Validators for a container node consists of a mix of all container validators and all its nested member validators.
But they can't be put under one `List`, as they are functions on different Data Types.

[source,java,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
----
ValidatorEtr<Container, ValidationFailure> containerValidator =...; // Apply same analogy for Validator
ValidatorEtr<Member, ValidationFailure> memberValidator =...;
List.of(containerValidator, memberValidator); // ^^^ Compile Error
----

So all nested member validators need to be lifted to the container type, essentially changing their type matching with the Container's, like: `ValidatorEtr<Container, ValidationFailure>`.

We can achieve this with `org.revcloud.vader.lift.++*++Util` functions.
These are *Higher-Order Functions* which *lift* member validator to the container type.
This takes a `containerToMemberMapper` which is the function to extract member-bean from container-bean.

[source,java,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
----
ValidatorEtr<Member, ValidationFailure> memberValidator =...;
ValidatorEtr<Container, ValidationFailure> liftedMemberValidator =...;
List.of(containerValidator, liftToContainerValidatorType(memberValidator, containerToMemberMapper)); // Happy Compiler :)
----

This way, we can configure a *Chain* of validators in-order, sorting out all the container-member dependencies.
This is nothing but, the most popular *Chain of Responsibility* Design pattern, with a functional touch-up.

If the inter-dependencies between Container-Member happens to be more complex, we may end-up with _Graph_ relationship, but we can easily _flatten_ it into a Chain with a simple _Topological Sort_.

=== How to combine Validators & ValidatorEtrs?

Similarly, Vader has utils to lift `Validator` to `ValidatorEtr`.
This is handy, when you have a mix of validations, and they all need to be of the same type to stitch them together.

=== Lift Util

Below are the utils currently available, with self-explanatory names.
There are multiple overloads suitable for simple/non-simple.
The Java Docs should guide you to use proper overload:

==== Aggregation Util: To lift Member validator to Container validator type

These are available for both `Validator` and `ValidatorEtr`.

|liftToContainerValidatorType |liftAllToContainerValidatorType
|liftToContainerValidatorType |liftAllToContainerValidatorType

==== Validator Util: To lift Simple validator to ValidatorEtr type
