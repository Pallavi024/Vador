Vader provides few matchers out of the box to help write Specs. These matchers address generic use-cases common among
consumers. New matchers can be added as needed/requested. Currently, these are the available matchers:

* AnyMatchers
** `anyOf`
** `anyOfOrNull`
* DateMatchers
** `isOnOrBeforeIfBothArePresent`
** `isBeforeIfBothArePresent`
** `isEqualToDayOfDate`
* IntMatchers
** inRangeInclusive
