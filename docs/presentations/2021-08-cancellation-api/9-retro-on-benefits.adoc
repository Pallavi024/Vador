== Readability

We don't need analogies to stress on how important readability is and how Config is more readable than code with nested `if/else/for`.

== Maintainability 

Strips out a lot of the code/logic to maintain.

== Complexity 

* No branching => No Cyclomatic complexity. 
* It abstracts away all the implementation complexity.
* Saves a lot of Man hours while writing and 10X more while reading. An *8-pointer Story for Free* ü§ë

== Testability 

Think of writing config as fill in the blanks for well-tested algorithm templates, so you don't need to write any code, which implies no need to write any tests.

NOTE: You can always test your config (to double-check if right values are provided), but no need to re-test the already well-tested implementation.

== Flexibility 

* This is decoupled from the API orchestration method. For example, currently it's *Fail-Fast for Any*.
But if you want to migrate to Fail-Fast for each item (to handle partial failures) or if you have another route like SObject where you need to accumulate all errors, that's as simple as calling a different API method without changing anything else.
* If you wish to skip some validations or add new validations depending on the route, you can have different configs instances for different routes.

== Extensibility

Config can easily be changed or extended or reused.

== Re-usability

Config is mapped to a data structure. Which means, if the validation requirements are same, you can *reuse* the config everywhere the data-structure is used, say in a different API. 

== Learning Curve

We use the same Config pattern through-out, with self-explaining DSL methods to drive your development. This keeps the scope and slope of your learning curve required, low.
