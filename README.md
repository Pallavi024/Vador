# Why Vader?

## [Requirements that lead to the birth of Vader](docs/requirements.md)

** On core, there is no defacto standard to write bean validations**. Generally, validation orchestration is predominantly done with `if-else-try-catch` pyramids, similar
to [this]([railway-oriented-validation/ImperativeValidation.java at master ¬∑ overfullstack/railway-oriented-validation (github.com)](https://github.com/overfullstack/railway-oriented-validation/blob/master/src/main/java/app/imperative/ImperativeValidation.java)).
A domain may have more than 60 validations across its batch & non-batch services. Having validations as loose
functions for the above requirements, can create a mess of function calls:

![inline](images/function-call-mess.png)

This approach can spike the [**Cyclomatic Complexity**](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-cq03316/)
and [**Cognitive Complexity**] (https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf) metrics and renders a
code-base which is difficult to test, extend and maintain.

### The 3D design problem

This problem is a 3-dimensional design problem stretching among - Sub-requests, Service routes (
sharing common fields & nodes), and Validation count. In the above imperative approach, we entangled all 3, which lead
to chaos. We need a design, which treats all of these separately, let them be extended independently, and abstracts out
validation sequencing and orchestration.

**We need to separate *What-to-do* from *How-to-do.***

manage and how Vader disciplines your code-base:

# What is Vader?

**Vader is an independent Bean validation framework, not tied to any REST framework**. It's agnostic of its consumer's
Rest framework, Request data-type or failure representation. Although it's written with the context explained above, its
implementation is generic and can cater to anyone looking for a declarative way to validate their Beans/POJOs.

Vader follows **Functional Programming** philosophy to segregate *What-to-do* from *How-to-do*. The framework needs your
validations to be broken into 3 ***decoupled*** parts:

- Validations *(What-to-do)* - Write your validations as First-Class Functions.
- Configuration *(How-to-do)* - Stitch your validations together into a Chain.
- Orchestration *(How-to-do)* - Call the API function as per the execution strategy (Fail-Fast or Error-Accumulation)

Let's deep dive into how Vader can help you in each of these steps:

---

# ∆õ Data-types for Lambda

The job of validator is simple, just to convey if a POJO is valid or why it's invalid (in the form of a Validation
Failure).

Vader provides various **Validator Data-Types**, to get this done. These
are [Functional Interfaces](https://www.baeldung.com/java-8-functional-interfaces) to which a lambda can be assigned.

## Validator `(ValidatableT) -> FailureT`

The Data type for simple first-class functions. It takes in a bean to be validated, represented by `ValidatableT`, and
returns a failure `FailureT`. This is prefixed *Simple* as it works with Simple types as Input/Output.

```java
public static final Validator<Container, ValidationFailure> validation1 =
  containerInputRepresentation -> {
    if(containerInputRepresentation._isSetPaymentAuthorizationId()) {
      return null;
    } else{
      return new ValidationFailure(ApiErrorCodes.REQUIRED_FIELD_MISSING,FIELD_NULL_OR_EMPTY,
      ERROR_LABEL_PARAM_PAYMENT_AUTHORIZATION_ID);
    }
  };
```

### If you need more ‚ö°Ô∏èPower‚ö°Ô∏è

![inline](images/more-power.gif)

## ValidatorEtr (`Either<FailureT, ValidatableT>) -> Either<FailureT, ?>`)

### Either Monad

Unlike `Validator` type (which works with Simple input/output types), `ValidatorEtr` lambda type works with `Either` type as
input/output. The `Either` type is borrowed from [Vavr](https://docs.vavr.io/#_either).

### What's so powerful about `Either`?

With `Either`, You get all the functional programming powers. You can write linear programs with a lot less **Cyclomatic
Complexity** & **Cognitive Complexity**.

Please refer to this tech talk discussing these
concepts: [Fight Complexity with Functional Programming - Gopal S. Akshintala - All Things Open, USA, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvr6gx4XaD8&list=PLrJbJ9wDl9EC0bG6y9fyDylcfmB_lT_Or)

Lambdas assigned to `ValidatorEtr` take `Either<FailureT, ValidatableT>` as input. Since the input is pre-wrapped in
an `Either`, you can perform all the `Either` operations on the input like `map`
, `flatMap`, `fold`, `filterOrElse` (
Refer [API](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.vavr/vavr/0.10.2/io/vavr/control/Either.html) for more info).

The result of the function is supposed to be `Either<FailureT, ?>`. This signifies, if there is a Validation Failure,
keep it in the *left* state. If the `Either` in the result is in the *right* state, it is considered that the bean **
Passed** the validation. The wildcard `?` signifies it doesn't matter what is the value in the right state.

```java
public static final ValidatorEtr<Container, ValidationFailure> batchValidation1 =
  containerInputRepresentation -> containerInputRepresentation
    .filterOrElse(Container::_isSetAccountId, ignore-> new ValidationFailure(
    ApiErrorCodes.REQUIRED_FIELD_MISSING,FIELD_NULL_OR_EMPTY,
    ERROR_LABEL_PARAM_PAYMENT_AUTHORIZATION_ID));
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Of-course, pre-wrapping into `Either` is just to avoid boiler-plate. You can very well use `Validator` and
wrap/unwrap it yourself.

## Why are there different Validator types?

These types only differ stylistically. They are there to help developers focus only on their validation logic, not worry
about boiler-plate and use a programming style (imperative or functional) that they are comfortable in. You can
essentially use any Data type for your validators and in-fact you can even have a mix, based on your needs. Vader leaves
the choice to the developer.

---

# How to Stitch these Validators?

Validators for different beans can be written in their own java classes. Using lambdas, we essentially **use functions
as values**. So, all we need is an Ordered List (like `java.util.List`)
to maintain the sequence of validations. We can chain all the validators, in the order of preference.

```java
List<ValidatorEtr<Container, ValidationFailure> validatorChain = List.of(validator1,validator2,...);
```

## How to combine Container & Member validators?

But there's a catch! A List of Validators for a container node consists of a mix of all container validators and all its
nested member validators. But they can't be put under one `List`, as they are functions on different Data Types.

```java
ValidatorEtr<Container, ValidationFailure> containerValidator =...; // Apply same anology for Validator
ValidatorEtr<Member, ValidationFailure> memberValidator =...;
List.of(containerValidator, memberValidator); // ^^^ Compile Error
```

So all nested member validators need to be lifted to the container type, essentially changing their type matching with
the Container's, like: `ValidatorEtr<Container, ValidationFailure>`.

We can achieve this with `org.revcloud.vader.lift.*Util` functions. These are **Higher-Order Functions**, which **lift** member validator to the container type. This takes
a `containerToMemberMapper` which is function to extract member from container.

```java
ValidatorEtr<Member, ValidationFailure> memberValidator =...;
ValidatorEtr<Container, ValidationFailure> liftedMemberValidator =...;
List.of(containerValidator, liftToContainerValidatorType(memberValidator,containerToMemberMapper)); // Happy Compiler :)
```

**This is a powerful technique, which lets you validate any Bean with any level or nesting. It's easy to fit this model
in our heads, as validator configuration aligns with Bean hierarchical-structure**

![inline](images/hierarchical-validation.png)

This way, we can configure a **Chain** of validators in-order, sorting out all the container-member dependencies. This
is nothing but, the most popular **Chain of Responsibility** Design pattern, with a functional touch-up.

If the inter-dependencies between Container-Member happens to be more complex, we may end-up with *
Graph* relationship, but we can easily *flatten* it into a Chain with a simple *Topological Sort*.

## How to combine SimpleValidators & Validators?

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you are using [`*ValidationConfig` DSL](docs/configDSLs.md) from 2.0, you don't need to worry about this, unless you are particular about the order of validators.

Similarly, Vader has utils to lift `Validator` to `ValidatorEtr`. This is handy, when you have a mix of validations, and they all need to be of the same type to stitch them together.

## Lift Util

Below are the utils currently available, with self-explanatory names. There are multiple overloads suitable for simple/non-simple. The Java Docs should guide you to use proper overload:

#### Aggregation Util: To lift Member validator to Container validator type

These are available for both `Validator` and `ValidatorEtr`.

|  |  |
| :---        |    :---   |
| liftToContainerValidatorType | liftAllToContainerValidatorType |
| liftToContainerValidatorType | liftAllToContainerValidatorType |

#### Validator Util: To lift Simple validator to ValidatorEtr type

|      |         |
| :--- | :---    |
| lift | liftAll |
|      |         |

## Deferred result

If you skim through the source code, you can realize none of these Util functions does any execution. These Higher-Order functions simply take-in a function and return a lifted function, deferring the actual execution until you call any API method in the *Runner* API below:

---

# Validation Execution Strategies

Now that we know how to write & wire validations, the last step to execute these validations is to **call an execution method, passing this config as a parameter**.

This can be seen as the **Edge** for validation bounded context, where the actual execution of validations happen, and you get back the final results. *The complexity of how these validators are orchestrated per strategy is abstracted away from the consumer.*

**There are various flavors (Overloads) in the Runner for Batch/Non-Batch and Simple/Non-Simple (
Please refer to Java Docs)**.

### `validateAndFailFastForEach(...)`

### `validateAndFailFastForAny(...)`

### `validateAndAccumulateErrors(...)`

## What about exceptions?

These Runner methods accept a parameter called `throwableMapper (Throwable) -> FailureT`. If any of your validations
throws a checked or unchecked exception, it shall be mapped into a failure representation using this throwableMapper
function.

# Current State

- This idea was presented as a Tech-talk at many [International Conferences & Meetups](https://overfullstack.ga/posts/fight-complexity-with-fp/#My-Talk-on-this)
- This is currently consumed in **Production** by Payments, Tax and Billing domains.

## Future

- Context-aware validations to share data among validations

# For Contributors

## Source-code Setup

- This is a simple Gradle project and has its own Gradle wrapper. So nothing to install. As of writing this, Gradle v7.0 is used. You need to add your nexus credentials in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file, which are used by your local gradle to connect to nexus.

  ```properties
    nexusUsername=...
    nexusPassword=....
  ```

- For source code navigation you need to have [**Lombok**](https://projectlombok.org/) plugin, which is used to generate
  boilerplate code. There are plugins available for Lombok for all popular IDEs, which you need to install. The latest
  version of the plugin should work.
- It uses **[google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format)**. Your check-in fails if you don‚Äôt adhere to this style. Please set up your IDE to follow this formatting, following instructions [here](https://github.com/HPI-Information-Systems/Metanome/wiki/Installing-the-google-styleguide-settings-in-intellij-and-eclipse)

---

## CI/CD

- The CI/CD pipeline is all set up for this library. A CI/CD jenkins job runs for every commit push on any branch.
  However, to publish a jar to nexus, only commits on `master` branch are considered. You can get more information
  from `JenkinsFile` at the root of this repo.
- The job status can be monitored [here](https://ccspaymentsci.dop.sfdc.net/job/validation/job/Vader/job/master/) or wait for the build-sheild at the top to turn red/green.

## Manual publishing

- If you want to manually publish jar to nexus from you local, you need to have the necessary permissions to release jar
  into Nexus for both SNAPSHOTS and RELEASE channels. This Gus item was raised for Nexus access: https://gus.my.salesforce.com/a07B0000007Qt0BIAS. Please reach out to this team for any Nexus related permissions,
  problems, or requirements.
- As of today, the permissions are maintained by providing a role `CCSPayments`. We are planning to create an AD group
  for this.
- In `build.gradle.kts` file in root, increment the version property `version = "<Version-Number>"` and run this command:

  ```shell
  ./gradlew publish
  ```
- After publishing, you can verify it by searching in the [Nexus Repo](https://nexus.soma.salesforce.com/nexus/index.html#welcome).
